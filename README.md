   - Category filter
   - City filter
   - Room class filter

2. **Key Metrics Table**:
   - Property-wise breakdown of metrics including Revenue, Total Bookings, RevPAR, Occupancy %, ADR, DSRN, DBRN, DURN, Realisation %, Cancellation %, and Average Rating

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Weekly trends of RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy %

4. **Day Type Analysis**:
   - Comparison of RevPAR, Occupancy %, ADR, and Realisation % for weekends vs weekdays

5. **Platform Analysis**:
   - Realisation % and ADR by booking platform

6. **Revenue Distribution**:
   - Revenue breakdown by room class
   - Revenue percentage by category (Luxury vs Business)
